Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.\n\n For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world (air, earth, fire, and water) must remain in equilibrium. Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature and hate the unnatural. Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature.",

Some sorcerers can\u2019t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their lives.

By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.
